WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE FOR A PLAYABLE PRE-ALPHA:

Linear arena progression.
Player permadeath, have to restart from the beginning.
Players can choose a starting kit to enhance their experience based on how far they got.
We need an arena map (I think it should have a base roman-esque arena barier with variation on the terrain through levels)
Fix collision errors (including the player sticking to walls)
We need a main menu with the appropriate stuff on it (i.e. game start screen with loadout picker)
