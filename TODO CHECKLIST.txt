Gameplay Ideas
--------------------
Linear arena progression.
Player permadeath, have to restart from the beginning.
	Players can choose a starting kit to enhance their experience based on how far they got.
Mini-objectives in each map to give the player a boost for the next arena, like exclusive spells and weapons.
Different sorts of armor that protect against different sorts of damage.
Stat points that one can spend on increasing their attack, speed, etc.
