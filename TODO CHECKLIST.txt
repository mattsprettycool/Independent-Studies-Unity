//PRE-ALPHA CHECKLIST

Textures - weapons, icons, enemies, walls, floor
More enemies
More Weapons
More Spells
Map
Player model????

WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE FOR A PLAYABLE PRE-ALPHA:

Linear arena progression.
Player permadeath, have to restart from the beginning.
We need an arena map (I think it should have a base roman-esque arena barier with variation on the terrain through levels)
Fix collision errors (including the player sticking to walls)
